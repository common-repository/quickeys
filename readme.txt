Easy and Powerful tool to make it possible for visitors to navigate through your blog with keyboard.

== Description ==

QuicKeys (aka WP Keyboard Navigation) is a plugin that makes your blog keyboard navigatable. Visitors to your site will be able to use keys that you assign (QKs) to navigate almost anywhere in your site – all depends on what you allow.

**New Feature on version 0.9 -** Disable QuicKeys in specific Posts / Pages.

**On the current version, you can assign shortcuts to:**
 
* Previous Post (or Page).
* Next Post (or Page).
* Previous Post in same category (or Page).
* Next Post in same category (or Page).
* Home Page.
* Random Post.
* Next Attachment.
* Prev Attachment.
* A Specific Page (as many as you want).
* A Specific Post (as many as you want).
* A Sepcific Category (again, as many as you want).

All done easily from the backend.

If you are missing a QK (quickey) – drop us a line, we’d love to extend this plugin for your needs!

QuicKey’s is hooked to wp_footer(), so make sure your theme is calling wp_footer. Moreover, QuicKey’s won’t work without javascript. But apart from that, its pretty damn cool!

**Coming Soon :**

* More hotkey possibilities.
* Legend Widget.
* Admin Area Keyboard navigation.
